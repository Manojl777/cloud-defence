Explainable AI-Driven Intrusion Detection System for Cloud: A Hybrid LSTM based approach

üîê Intrusion Detection System (Hybrid LSTM + XAI)

This project implements a deep learning-based intrusion detection system using a hybrid Conv1D + BiLSTM architecture.  
Train the same model using different datasets and upload their trained `.h5` models here.

‚û°Ô∏è Use `train_template.ipynb` in Google Colab to start training.
